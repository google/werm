Name: Shinonome font family

Notes:
Werm includes size 7x14 for this family. The font has been converted to ttf.
We use a couple of local tweaks:
  * Zero and uppercase O are more distinct because of the slash in the middle of
    zero.
  * The vertical pipe is broken in the middle, to help distinguish with
    lowercase ell.
  * The number 1 has a larger protruding top and base.
  * Lowercase a has a shorter second-story roof.
  * The tilde is wavy instead of straight.
  * Some extra line-drawing and Kanji characters were added.
