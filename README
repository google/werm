werm: Web-based terminal multiplexer

werm is a terminal multiplexer and emulator empowered by browser tabs and your
OS's desktop features.

Usually we would use a terminal multiplexer to maintain sessions and manage
multiple terminals over a single SSH connection. The drawback to this approach
is you cannot take advantage of your window manager features or more generally,
the features of your OS's desktop environment.

In recent times, Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers introduced a feature
to search open tabs. If your shells were tabs, you would be able to search
them. If your shells are accessed and customized via URLs, you would be able to
access them with bookmarks. If your shells are first-class windows (and not
tmux or GNU screen panes), you can distribute them between multiple desktops and
multiple monitors and possibly snap them to the sides of your screens or tile
them, depending on what window manager you are using.

The purpose of werm is to unlock these features when working with terminal
sessions.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

FEATURES

 * Ability to jump to different sessions using Ctrl+Shift+A (Chrome feature)

 * Macros. Macros start with left or right alt and are a sequence of keys of
   arbitrary length. No chording is required when typing the macro activator
   sequence.

 * Detachability (close the tab and the shell is still alive)

 * Pixel-perfect bitmap fonts of various sizes which can even render on high-DPI
   screens without blur.

 * Multiple shell "profiles," each cloneable and initialized with its own
   command or rc file

 * Profile name is in tab title so you can search for it

 * Most of what is in hterm (the engine for chromeOS SSH App and Crostini
   terminals)

 * Works on any OS with a Chromium-based browser, including chromeOS and LaCros
   chromeOS

 * Operate a terminal on your local machine or a remote one with a local
   browser.

 * Shows active shell sessions and available profiles at
   http://localhost:<port>/attach. (This page can also be opened from a terminal
   with macros.)

 * Overloaded decorator keys for easier coding and shell interaction: can type
   certain characters more easily

   * Done by pressing L/R shift keys, L/R ctrl keys, without chording with other
     keys; or the menu key
   * Look for "deadkey_map" or "menu_key_inserts" in index.html to customize the
     inserted characters.

  * Keyboard layout remapping (search for "remap_keys" in index.html for an
    explanation)

QUICKSTART

 * chromeOS is the most thoroughly tested client OS at this time

 * Non-Chromium-based browsers have not been tested

 * The Werm server only runs on Linux

 * On your local or remote Linux machine, clone this repo to a convenient place
   and build. I recommend ~/.local/werm/src:

   $ mkdir -p ~/.local/werm
   $ cd ~/.local/werm
   $ git clone <repo_url> src
   $ cd src
   $ ./build

   The first time you build it will download Go to compile a third-party
   component. This takes a little longer. It keeps Go inside the werm directory.

   ~/.local/werm/src, or wherever you choose to put the Werm source, is known as
   $WERMSRCDIR. This environment variable is available to all child processes of
   the server, including terminal sessions.

 * Start the server.

   FOR THE WEB SERVER TO OPERATE THE LOCAL MACHINE

   Run: $ ./run --port=8090 --address=localhost

   Note that any logged in user will be able to start a shell as the user, since
   the port is accessible on localhost.

   This is sufficient for single-user machines. The opened port can be accessed
   in a local web browser or remotely with local ssh port forwarding:

   $ ssh ... -L 8090:werm-server:8090

   FOR THE WEB SERVER TO OPERATE A REMOTE MACHINE, or your local machine on
   which other users may log in, you should host the server on a Unix domain
   socket (UDS) so only one user has access:

   $ umask 0077
   $ ./run --uds=/tmp/werm.$USER.sock

   And then use port forwarding in your SSH command arguments (works with Chrome
   SSH extension, and any port number) to connect from your local machine:

   $ ssh ... -L 8090:/tmp/werm.<USER>.sock

 * Open localhost:8090 in your browser to get an ephemeral shell. This will
   terminate the shell as soon as the tab is closed or the connection is lost.

 * To open a persistent shell, use the localhost:8090/attach page. See
   ATTACH PAGE for details.

 * Rather than use the attach page to reconnect to a shell, you can also re-open
   the URL e.g. with a bookmark or Ctrl+Shift+T.

 * While any shell is open, type "laH T " to start a new persistent shell

HOW TO READ MACRO SHORTCUTS

To understand macros cited in this guide, you will need to know how
to activate them with the noted shortcut. Each shortcut is a plain string with
an even number of characters (this is how they are expressed compactly in the
source in long lists).

This syntax is also important in defining your own macros.

Each macro starts with either left alt or right alt.

Each key is represented by two characters. Even if a key is a modifier such as
alt, shift, or ctrl, there is no need to hold down the modifier.

Left and right modifiers of each kind are distinguished in the shortcut, so you
have to press the right one. Here are the most common keys that are used in
shortcuts:

 * Capital letter followed by space, e.g. "X " or "A " indicates that alphabetic
   key.
 * Number followed by a space is that number on the top row of the keyboard.
 * Punctuation such as [ or , followed by a space is the non-numpad key which
   inserts that punction.
 * Numpad keys are indicated by a '#' followed usually but not always by a
   numeric digit.
 * la and ra are the alt keys, ls and rs are shift, and lc and rc are control.
 * sp is the spacebar

native_to_mn in index.html defines the complete mapping between two-character
mnemonics and the human-readable name used by the JS Event API.

BASIC USE

 * An ephemeral shell will terminate if you close the tab. You will create one
   simply by navigating to http://localhost:<port>/. To close an ephemeral
   shell, just use Ctrl+W or close the tab.

 * A persistent shell stays alive even when the tab closes or the connection is
   lost. Terminate such a shell with Ctrl+D or the "exit" command before closing
   the tab.

 * Press Shift+Backspace to send Ctrl+W (delete word) to the shell.

 * To add or remove macros, add it to the macro_map in index.html or a
   profile's JS code (see PROFILES section).

   The left-hand side is the macro shortcut or mnemonic.

   The right-hand side is the string to enter or function to invoke. Use \r for
   return. Do not use macro shortcuts like "es" (escape) here, just the raw
   string.

 * Fonts are changed with "raF N **" where ** is 'A ' to 'I ' in roughly
   increasing size. E.g. press right-alt, F, N, A in sequence to choose the
   smallest font. Ctrl-= and Ctrl-minus also work to change zoom, though this
   will cause blur if it is not 200% or 300% zoom.

 * Meta (i.e. super, apple on MacOS, search on ChromeOS) key is used in place of
   Alt for the terminal process. This is to allow Alt to be used for the start
   of macros. Note that on ChromeOS and e.g. Windows, meta pressed alone cannot
   be intercepted by Javascript, so meta is not used for macros.

ATTACH PAGE

Open the attach page by going to http://localhost:8090/attach, or using the
"rarsS T " or "rarsA T " macros from within a terminal (see HOW TO READ MACRO
SHORTCUTS). The former shortcut uses a new tab (Separate) while the latter
replaces the current tab.

From the attach page you can create or reconnect to persistent sessions.

 * use a link in the "Existing" section to open an existing persisent session

 * the list labeled "New" on the left side of /attach contains a line
   for every defined "profile." Any of these links will start a new session.
   using that profile. To add a profile to get a particular workflow started,
   see PROFILES.

 * The "New" list always starts with a "basic" link, which starts a profile with
   an empty name.

SCROLLBACK FEATURES

 * To access the scrollback buffer, press "laH L ". This opens a new tab and
   runs `less` viewing the scrollback buffer. From there, you can close the
   scrollback viewer by simply closing the tab (it is an ephemeral session). If
   you quit `less`, then you will return to a shell. In this shell, the
   following commands and shell variables are available:

   $logfile	the path of the scrollback file
   lel		runs `less $logfile` (LEss Log)
   rflt <args>	sends the lines in log in reverse order to `sed <args>`. For
		example, `rflt '/$ grep/q; /\.h:/d'` would recall the output of
		the just-run grep command but exclude matches found in C header
		files (Reverse FiLTer)
   rfmt <args>	same as `rflt`, but while `rflt` pipes output through `less`,
		`rfmt` uses `more`
   dl		runs `cat $logfile` (Dump Log)

   These and other functions are defined in $WERMSRCDIR/util/logview

 * Open the scrollback in a new tab in an HTML <textarea> with macro "laH M " to
   get browser-native scrolling, searching, copying behavior. This does not use
   the alternate screen, but only the primary screen's scrollback, so you
   probably won't see editor or `less` content. This macro is defined in a tab
   with a terminal ID, but not an ephemeral terminal.

   * In the scrollback tab, to copy the selection, you may press Enter as an
     alternative to Ctrl+C followed by Ctrl+W.

 * Show the visible text only in an HTML <textarea> with 'laH N '. This works
   with editor and UI screens, unlike 'laH M '. But everything else about its
   use is the same (Enter to copy text and close the tab).

 * Scrollbacks are saved to disk in $WERMSRCDIR/var/YEAR/MONTH/DAY, excluding
   any content printed to the alternate screen. You can turn off the scrollback
   feature and thereby prevent the logs from being written to disk by adding the
   "sblvl=" argument to $WERMFLAGS (see WERMFLAGS ENVVAR). The default value of
   sblvl is "p" which means Plain scrollback logging is enabled. Setting sblvl
   to "rp" (e.g. "export WERMFLAGS='sblvl=rp'") would also turn on Raw logging,
   which saves the exact subprocess stdout/stderr streams in files named
   '*.raw'.

WERMFLAGS ENVVAR

The environment variable WERMFLAGS is a URL query string without the leading
question mark, e.g. "foo=1&bar=2" or "baz=3". This must be set when starting the
server, and the following values are supported:

dtachlog=	set to anything to enable detailed logging for the dtach
		component to /tmp/dtachlog.<pid> files
sblvl=		see SCROLLBACK FEATURES

PROFILES

A profile is meant to label and setup a starting state for a shell session. It
can be used to quickly accomplish a certain task or prepare to enter a certain
personalized workflow.

Profiles are divided into groups, and each profile has a NAME, an initialization
COMMAND, and an optional list of JAVASCRIPT files that the client will load,
generally to just define macros.

Each profile group is defined by a single file in $WERMSRCDIR/profiles or
$HOME/.config/werm/profiles. If $WERMPROFPATH is defined when running |run|,
the paths in *that* are searched instead. To include more than one path in
$WERMPROFPATH, separate separate them with a ':'.

The "group" feature is optional, meaning you may choose to put all of your
profiles in a single group. Multiple groups are useful because the /attach page
displays vertical space between each group. Multiple groups also allow you to
define profiles across multiple files and directories.

The profile associated with a terminal ID is the portion of the terminal ID
before the first '.', or the entire terminal ID if there is no '.'.

Profile names may not contain the characters: %.+=&?\/" and space and tab.

A profile is defined by one line in its group file, and each line contains 1, 2,
or 3 fields separated by a tab. Field one is the profile name. Field two is the
preamble. Field three is the Javascript files to load with that profile, without
the .js extension, separated by commas. Here is an example group file:

profile-foo<--TAB-->source ~/.foorc<--TAB-->foo-macros1,foo-macros2,common-macros
bar-profile<--TAB-->source ~/.barrc<--TAB-->bar-macros,common-macros
basic<--TAB-->source ~/.basicrc
no-preamble<--TAB--><--TAB-->common-macros
<--TAB--># basic<--TAB-->common

The first two profiles have all fields defined. The third profile has no extra
JS to load, and the fourth profile has no preamble.

The fifth profile has no name. The empty-name profile is the _basic_ profile,
which always appears at the top of the New list in /attach. This is also the
profile used for ephemeral sessions.

CUSTOM PROFILES: PREAMBLE

The preamble is typed automatically for you into the terminal when a new process
has been started. If the preamble is not empty, a \n is automatically typed
after it as well.

CUSTOM PROFILES: JAVASCRIPT

JS is loaded from directories listed in $WERMJSPATH, which is specified in the
environment when running "$WERMSRCDIR/run", and lists directories separated by
colons, i.e. :

If $WERMJSPATH is not defined, it defaults to $WERMSRCDIR/js:$HOME/.config/werm/js

For instance, if the JS field of a profile is "a,b,c", then Javascript will be
loaded from any file named a.js, b.js, or c.js, in any directory in $WERMJSPATH.
If the .js file is executable, it is executed and its stdout taken. Otherwise,
the files contents are taken as-is.

For a given profile, each .js file is concatenated together and loaded as a
single <script> element. To see the final .js file in use in a profile, open a
terminal with the profile and enter the macro "laO P J S ". This will re-generate
the .js file *again* and show it, rather than simply show what was really loaded
and in effect for the page. (FIXME: this is not ideal)

The Javascript generally takes the form of extra macro maps put in the map at
window.extended_macros, which look like the macro_map in index.html, e.g.:

(in foo.js)
window.extended_macros.foo_macros = [
	['raD T ', 'third_party/dtach'],
	['raW S ', 'third_party/websocketd'],
];
(in bar.js)
window.extended_macros.bar_macros = [
	...
];

TERMINAL ID

When the process of a non-ephemeral terminal starts, it claims an ID of the form
"<profile_name>.<uniq_id>". The <profile_name> is empty for the basic profile.
<uniq_id> is an ID which is designed be opaque but short and unique even among
all profiles. This ID is used in log file names, browser tab names, and `ps`
output for Werm-releated processes. The unique ID is a base 34 number matching
the regex [a-z2-9]+ where the least significant digit is first, so typing
".<two characters>" is enough to identify the name out of all recently spawned
terminals.

To reset the unique ID back to a single digit, delete the file that begins with
`$WERMSRCDIR/var/nextterid.` at any time.

CAPSLOCK SIMULATION AND AUTO-OFF

If you are using a Chromebook or have mapped your physical Caps Lock to
something else, you can still get capslock functionality in Werm. This is done
with the capsonwhile variable, which you set in a custom macro.

capsonwhile should be set to a regex which is compared against each pressed
key's 2-char mnemonic. The first key that does not match will turn capslock
off. For example,

window.extended_macros.caps_example = [
	['raC ', function() { capsonwhile = /[A-Z0-9] /; }],
];

This means that 'raC ' will turn on a simulated capslock until a non-
alphabetic and non-numeric key is pressed. If you want to be able to type
underscores and keep capslock on, you can keeps capslock on when shift or
the dash/underscore key is pressed. That would be the regex
/[A-Z0-9] |ls|rs|- /.

Alternatively, set capsonwhile to /../ to turn capslock on (matches all keys)
and set capsonwhile to 0 to turn capslock off explicitly.

SUGGESTED UTILITIES

These are tools unaffiliated with Werm or Google which may make Werm more
convenient.

Tiling Window Manager for Chrome OS: tiles a screen into more than two windows
with the keyboard. You may not need this to only get two windows on the screen
at one time. In chromeOS, Alt+[ and Alt+] and Meta+Alt+M are sufficient to get
two windows per monitor, on any attached monitor.
