This is Werm! If the text is too small, press <right-alt (ra), F, N, K > to get
the largest font available. Replace K with an earlier letter for smaller fonts.
You can change the default font with the magic of profiles.

Open /readme on this server for documentation, which includes help for profiles
and macros. Some key bindings may surprise you - see /readme#key-mappings if you
are having trouble.

This is an ephemeral shell, so it will terminate as soon as you close the tab or
lose connectivity with the server. Press <left-alt (la), H, T > to open a
persistent session. These survive disconnects, like your client going to sleep.

Press <rarsS T > or open "/attach" to see running shells and re-open one.
